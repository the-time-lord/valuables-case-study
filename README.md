### Valuables Case Study

This is a test task solution for technical interview. The app was primarily on iOS systems: iPhone 14 emulator and iPhone 12 mini. Therefore some layout issues on Android were not fixed.

### Known issues

- Keyboard covers the description field in the add item modal, I could make KeyboardAvoidingView work.
- Long item names are cut-off without an ellipsis
- The Layout is broken on Android
- Value parsing is pretty naive and doesn't take floats
- It's not possible to close the Image picker modal by tapping outside
